# Video Background Setup

## Instructions

1. Place your video file in this folder (`public/videos/`)
2. The video file should be named: `ScreenRecording_11-25-2025 02-00-27_1.mov`
3. For better browser compatibility, you can also add an MP4 version: `ScreenRecording_11-25-2025 02-00-27_1.mp4`

## File Location

Your video file should be at:
```
portfolio.github.io/public/videos/ScreenRecording_11-25-2025 02-00-27_1.mov
```

## Note

- The video will automatically play, loop, and be muted
- Make sure the video file is not too large (recommended: under 50MB for web)
- If the video has spaces in the filename, it should work, but consider renaming to remove spaces for better compatibility
